# Questions

## How did you approach solving the problem?
My approach was to create a proof of concept solution and then optimize the code.


## How did you verify your solution works correctly?
I ran the Program Main function and the NetLimiter application, and at the end, I came up with some Nunit Tests.


## How long did you spend on the exercise?
I've spent 5 hours.


## What would you add if you had more time and how?
If I had more time I would create:
- More Nunit Tests;
- A service to manage the file progress;
- Another projects to define the contracts;
- A service to optimize the Delay Time whenever something is wrong.
